        <h1>The Save Glitch on Chamber 18</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="main">
        <p>Chamber 18 contains 3 main areas, 1 of which gets skipped due to the use of the Saveglitch.<br/>
            The first area is tall consisting of platforms separated by toxic goo, which the player shouldn't fall into. Apart from the first platform each of them are higher up warranting the use of the Portal gun. The first part has 4 platforms, the first one the player gets to after walking out of the elevator, after that there's one in front then to the right and again to the right separated by toxic goo, here only the floor and roof are portalable. After that if the player turns the the left they can see 3 platforms which look like they could be connected but the middle one is further down than the others. Here almost everything is portalable. We have a door on the right which won't be seen with this glitch, but on the leftmost platform opens another door.<br/>
            This leads us to the second area of the chamber with a hallway, where you can't put portals. In this area there's a big drop to the left with a portalable floor allowing for a fling. Note here that beside this area everything is portalable, this will be useful with the glitch. In front of the player lies a pit of toxic goo and 4 portalable horizontal platforms each higher up requiring the player to use the aformentioned flinging to get to the end of the chamber which will be on the right once the player gets up to the top. Also note here that the floor before the ending elevator is portalable.
        </p>
        <p>The player is Chell, the protagonist of Portal and GLaDOS is talking to her over speakers, she mentions that <q>The experiment is nearing it's conclusion.</q> and that <q>The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked [garbled] cake</q>. Once Chell reaches the end of the chamber GLaDOS says <q>Well done! Be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions.</q>. This dialogue is irrelevant to the Save glitch but is important for the games storyline.</p>
        <p>The Save glitch can be done by putting the players camera through a portal without entering it, this can be done by putting the portal on a corner then standing paralell to it then saving and loading. The player starts by using this glitch, after they step out of the elevator and walk through the hallway to the first platform. They turn back and shoot an orange portal in the top left and a blue portal next to door, then the save glitch is performed in the aformentioned way with the blue portal. The player then turns around, goes back through the door they came out of, turns right and shoots the orange portal down at about a 30 degree angle. From the player's vision this would just hit the wall in front of them but due to the glitch it actually ends up on the fourth platform of the first area. Afterwards the player is rotated 90 degrees to the right and can see the portalable surface above the door leading to the second area. They shoot an orange portal there and then on the floor before the door. At this point the player can walk up to the door which again changes the perspective seeing the wall right where we started. This time they shoot an orange portal on the top of the area next to the big drop. They now see the second area and are still rotated, they shoot an orange portal in the top far corner of the wall on the right. After walking backwards they move the blue portal to the left side of the wall it's on and turn back to walk to the door frame that is at the start of the chamber. By crouching down and shooting a portal pretty much next to the doorframe it ends up on the first platform of the second area. Due to the save glitch no flings are required because the player's camera is above the ending area's portalable floor. By shooting an orange portal there, saving and loading they exit the save glitch and shoot a blue portal to jump through getting to the elevator and ending Chamber 18.</p>
